                            <p className=''>I started programming for the first time in the <span className='font-medium text-primary'>&quot;Computer and Programming&quot;</span> subject while I was in my first year of electrical engineering (2 years ago). As I continued to study this course, I discovered that I enjoyed solving problems and writing programs. This subject was a turning point in my life, and it made me switch from electrical engineering to <span className='font-medium text-primary'>computer engineering</span> at <span className='font-medium text-primary'>Kasetsart University</span></p>
                            <p>When I first transferred, I had to work hard because I didn&apos;t have the same background as my friends. I started learning C and C++, which helped me learn about data structures and algorithms. Then, I discovered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which opened up a whole new world to me and helped me understand how websites work.</p>
                            <p>After that, I kept learning, whether it was frontend or backend, new languages, and I made small projects every time I had free time after class. I also had the opportunity to become a teaching assistant in a developer course for second-year students, which was a great experience. I also worked on a <span className='font-medium text-primary'>GIS (Geographic Information Systems)</span> project application , which was an application that showed the location of activities on my campus using Google Map APIs.</p>
                            <p>Now, I am interested in creating web applications and I am looking for opportunities to work on new projects.</p>
