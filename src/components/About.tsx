              <p>
                I am a fourth-year computer engineering student at Kasetsart
                University with a strong passion for software development. I
                have built several projects, including both frontend and backend
                applications using programming languages and frameworks such as
                Go, Node.js, React, and others. I believe that intelligence can
                be developed through dedication and hard work, and I am excited
                to apply my skills and knowledge to develop innovative and
                user-friendly software products.
